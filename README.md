# Question_Answering
Question Answering (QA) is a natural language processing (NLP) task that enables models to understand a given context and extract accurate answers to user queries. It is widely used in applications such as virtual assistants, chatbots, search engines, and customer support automation.

# Steps to build QA:
1. A pre-trained deep learning model (like deepset/roberta-base-squad2) is fine-tuned on large-scale question-answering datasets such as SQuAD.
   
2. The model takes the context and question as input and predicts the start and end positions of the answer within the context.

3.Tokenization and inference are performed to extract the most probable answer.

# Use Cases of Question Answering
✅ Virtual Assistants (Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant)
✅ Customer Support Automation
✅ Information Retrieval (Search Engines)
✅ Educational Chatbots
✅ Legal and Medical Document Analysis
